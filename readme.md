# 👩‍🦰🧔 Male–Female Classifier with Grad-CAM Visualization

A deep learning web application built using **Flask**, **TensorFlow**, and **OpenCV** that classifies gender from an uploaded or live-captured image.  
It also generates a **Grad-CAM heatmap** to visualize which regions of the image contributed most to the model’s decision.  

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🧠 **Deep Learning Model** – Trained CNN (EfficientNet or custom) for gender classification.  
- 🖼️ **Upload or Capture** – Upload an image or take one directly from your webcam.  
- 🔥 **Grad-CAM Visualization** – See the model’s attention heatmap overlayed on your photo.  
- ⚡ **Responsive UI** – Modern TailwindCSS interface with a futuristic dark theme.  
- 🚀 **Deployable Anywhere** – Works locally or on Render, Railway, or Heroku.
